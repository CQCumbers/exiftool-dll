# exiftool-dll
> Standalone exiftool DLL for C

This project builds exiftool as a single, self-contained DLL with C interface. It includes its own perl interpreter and lightweight wrapper over perl types, hopefully making it easier to integrate and interact with compared to e.g. shipping a seperate exiftool exe and managing it as a seperate process.
